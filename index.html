                    <details>
                        <summary>When did tacos first appar in the United States?</summary>
                        <p>
                            Tacos first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. The exact date is difficult to pinpoint, but it is believed that tacos gained popularity among Mexican immigrants and Mexican-American communities in the southwestern states, such as Texas and California, during the 1910s and 1920s. Over time, tacos gradually spread throughout the country and became a beloved staple of American cuisine. Today, tacos are widely enjoyed across the United States, with various regional and international influences shaping their diverse and delicious fillings and preparations.
